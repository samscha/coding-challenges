# Coding Challenges

## Install

```console
npm install && npm test
```

Make sure all tests pass (this will test the solutions), then

```console
cd JavaScript
```

(or whichever language you prefer and is available) and

start with question 1

```console
cd 1
```

and write inside `index.js` (or whichever file the test file checks)

#### Motivation

To solve coding challenges and share possible solutions.
